# Analytics Documentation

Comprehensive analytics and performance metrics for the Screeps AI bot.

## Overview

The analytics system provides detailed insights into bot performance, resource utilization, and strategic effectiveness. The analytics data is visualized through interactive charts on the documentation site, updated automatically during each deployment.

## Available Analytics

### Performance Metrics

- [**Bot Analytics Dashboard**](../analytics.html) - 30-day performance charts and metrics visualization including:
  - CPU usage trends and bucket levels
  - Room progression and RCL growth
  - Controller upgrade progress
  - Creep population statistics
  - Infrastructure development (extensions, towers, containers)
  - Memory utilization

### Data Collection

The analytics system collects daily snapshots of game state from the Public Test Realm (PTR) deployment. These snapshots are stored in `reports/bot-snapshots/` and capture:

- Room control levels (RCL) for each controlled room
- Controller progress toward next level
- CPU usage patterns (used, limit, bucket)
- Creep counts by role
- Structure counts (extensions, towers, containers, roads)
- Memory usage in bytes and percentage
- Energy available and capacity

### Chart Types

The analytics dashboard displays several chart types:

| Chart | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| CPU Usage | Line | Tracks CPU consumption over time |
| CPU Bucket | Line | Shows bucket level trends |
| Creep Count | Bar | Daily creep population |
| Room Statistics | Dual-axis Line | Room count and average RCL |
| Controller Progress | Area | Progress toward next RCL |
| Infrastructure | Stacked Bar | Structure counts by type |
| Memory Usage | Dual-axis Line | Memory in bytes and percentage |

### Data Pipeline

Analytics data is generated by the `generate-analytics.ts` script:

1. Reads snapshot files from `reports/bot-snapshots/`
2. Extracts and aggregates metrics from each snapshot
3. Filters valid room data (excludes metadata entries)
4. Outputs chart-ready JSON to `packages/docs/source/docs/analytics/data.json`

This script runs automatically during the documentation build process.
