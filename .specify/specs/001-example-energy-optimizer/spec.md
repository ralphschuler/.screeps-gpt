**Feature ID**: 001-example-energy-optimizer  
**Status**: Example  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-23  
**Author**: Spec-Kit Integration Team

## Overview

Optimize energy harvesting efficiency by intelligently selecting sources based on distance, traffic, and depletion rates. This feature improves the autonomous AI's resource gathering capabilities in the Screeps game environment.

## Problem Statement

Current energy harvesting logic uses simple proximity calculations without considering:

- Source depletion timing (when sources regenerate)
- Creep traffic congestion near popular sources
- Path efficiency accounting for terrain obstacles
- Dynamic rebalancing when conditions change

This leads to:

- Wasted CPU on inefficient paths
- Uneven source utilization
- Lower energy collection rates
- Suboptimal spawn positioning decisions

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

#### Story 1: Intelligent Source Selection

**As a** harvester creep  
**I want** to select the most efficient energy source  
**So that** I maximize energy collection while minimizing CPU and travel time

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Source selection considers distance, available energy, and current traffic
- [ ] Creep switches sources dynamically if conditions change
- [ ] CPU overhead for selection logic is < 0.5 per creep per tick
- [ ] Sources are balanced across available harvesters

#### Story 2: Traffic-Aware Pathing

**As a** harvester creep  
**I want** to avoid congested paths and sources  
**So that** I reduce idle time and movement inefficiencies

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Pathing algorithm accounts for other creep positions
- [ ] Congested sources (>3 creeps) are deprioritized
- [ ] Alternative paths are calculated when traffic is high
- [ ] Memory tracking persists traffic patterns

#### Story 3: Depletion Timing Optimization

**As a** harvester creep  
**I want** to time my arrival at sources with their regeneration  
**So that** I minimize idle waiting time

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Source regeneration timers are tracked in Memory
- [ ] Creeps target sources that will regenerate soonest
- [ ] Idle time at depleted sources is reduced by 50%
- [ ] Fallback behavior exists when all sources depleted

## Functional Requirements

### Core Requirements

1. **Source Efficiency Scoring**
   - Description: Calculate efficiency score per source considering distance, energy, and traffic
   - Priority: Critical
   - Dependencies: Memory system, pathfinding utilities

2. **Traffic Monitoring**
   - Description: Track creep count per source in Memory
   - Priority: High
   - Dependencies: Memory consistency helpers

3. **Depletion Tracking**
   - Description: Store and update source regeneration timers
   - Priority: High
   - Dependencies: Memory system, game tick tracking

4. **Dynamic Rebalancing**
   - Description: Allow creeps to switch sources when efficiency changes
   - Priority: Medium
   - Dependencies: Source scoring, traffic monitoring

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Scoring algorithm must complete in < 0.5 CPU per creep
- **Security**: No hardcoded coordinates or assumptions about map layout
- **Scalability**: Support up to 50 harvesters efficiently
- **Compatibility**: Work with existing creep role system in `src/runtime/behavior/`

## Technical Constraints

- Node.js 16.x compatibility required
- Must integrate with existing `src/runtime/behavior/roles/` structure
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Screeps API limitations on pathfinding and CPU
- Memory must be managed via `src/runtime/memory/` helpers
- CPU tracking via `src/runtime/metrics/`

## Out of Scope

- Container or link-based energy transfer (future enhancement)
- Remote mining optimization (different feature)
- Mineral harvesting (different resource type)
- Multi-room coordination (phase 2)
- Advanced path caching (optimization for later)

## Success Metrics

How will we measure success of this feature?

- Energy collection rate increases by 15% compared to baseline
- Average idle time per harvester decreases by 50%
- CPU overhead remains below 1.0 per harvester per tick
- Source utilization is balanced (no source > 150% usage of average)

## Clarifications

### Questions and Answers

**Q**: How should the algorithm handle sources in different rooms?  
**A**: Initial implementation is single-room only. Multi-room is out of scope.

**Q**: What happens when all sources are depleted simultaneously?  
**A**: Creeps should move to closest source and wait. Fallback to idle behavior at spawn.

**Q**: Should scoring weights be configurable?  
**A**: Yes, weights should be constants that can be tuned in testing.

**Q**: How frequently should traffic counts be updated?  
**A**: Every tick for accuracy, stored in volatile Memory (non-persistent across respawns).

## Dependencies

- **External Dependencies**: None (uses built-in Screeps API)
- **Internal Dependencies**:
  - `src/runtime/behavior/roles/harvester.ts` (modify)
  - `src/runtime/memory/` (use helpers)
  - `src/runtime/metrics/` (CPU tracking)
- **Infrastructure**: Screeps game environment, Memory object

## Risk Assessment

| Risk                  | Impact | Probability | Mitigation                                    |
| --------------------- | ------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| CPU overhead too high | High   | Medium      | Implement caching, optimize scoring algorithm |
| Memory leaks          | High   | Low         | Use memory helpers, add cleanup logic         |
| Pathfinding failures  | Medium | Medium      | Fallback to simple proximity scoring          |
| Source contention     | Low    | High        | Traffic monitoring handles this directly      |
