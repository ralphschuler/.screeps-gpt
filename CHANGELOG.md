## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Fixed build error caused by node-gyp attempting to use Python 2 syntax with Python 3
- Moved `@screeps/common`, `@screeps/driver`, `@screeps/engine`, and `screeps-server-mockup` packages to `optionalDependencies` to allow installation to succeed even when native modules fail to build
- Added `.npmrc` to configure build behavior for optional dependencies
- Mockup tests now gracefully skip when isolated-vm build fails (as documented in tests/mockup/README.md)

## [0.1.0] - 2024-06-01
