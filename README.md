# Screeps GPT

**An autonomous AI playground where multiple GitHub Copilot agents collaboratively develop, test, review, and deploy a Screeps bot.**

Screeps GPT is an experimental project that demonstrates how a swarm of specialized AI agents can autonomously manage the entire software development lifecycle of a [Screeps](https://screeps.com/) MMO bot. Built on GitHub Actions and the GitHub Copilot CLI, the system orchestrates development workflows, enforces quality standards, and continuously improves both the bot's game strategy and the development infrastructure itself.

## What is Screeps GPT?

Screeps GPT combines:

- **Autonomous Development**: AI agents write code, fix bugs, implement features, and refactor components based on issue specifications and monitoring feedback
- **Intelligent Automation**: GitHub Actions workflows powered by Copilot CLI handle code reviews, testing, deployment, and system monitoring
- **Self-Improving System**: The bot continuously evaluates its own performance in the Screeps game and generates improvement recommendations
- **Collaborative Agent Swarm**: Multiple specialized Copilot agents work togetherâ€”some focus on code quality, others on documentation, deployment, or performance monitoring

## System Architecture

The project operates through three integrated layers:

### 1. Runtime AI (Screeps Bot)

A TypeScript-based Screeps bot with autonomous creep management, resource optimization, and strategic decision-making. The bot runs in the Screeps MMO and is designed to be continuously improved by the agent swarm.

**Key Components:**

- Behavior controllers for creep roles (harvesters, upgraders, builders, miners)
- Memory management and state persistence
- Performance monitoring and CPU optimization
- Health evaluation and improvement recommendation system

### 2. Development Infrastructure

Bun-managed TypeScript codebase with comprehensive testing, linting, and build automation.

**Technology Stack:**

- **Runtime**: Bun 1.3+ with TypeScript targeting Node.js 18â€“22
- **Build**: esbuild for fast bundling
- **Testing**: Vitest with unit, e2e, and regression test suites
- **Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, pre-commit hooks

### 3. AI Agent Orchestration

GitHub Actions workflows that orchestrate specialized Copilot agents for different automation tasks.

**Agent Types:**

- **Issue Triage Agent**: Reformulates and labels incoming issues
- **Todo Agent**: Implements features from issue specifications
- **Review Agent**: Performs scheduled repository audits
- **CI Autofix Agent**: Automatically fixes failing workflows
- **Stats Monitor Agent**: Analyzes PTR performance and creates monitoring issues
- **Autonomous Monitor Agent**: Daily strategic analysis combining bot performance and repository health
- **Spec-Kit Agent**: Generates detailed implementation plans from requirements

See [Automation Overview](docs/automation/overview.md) for complete workflow documentation.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

## Key Features

### ðŸ¤– Autonomous Agent Swarm

Multiple specialized Copilot agents collaborate on different aspects of development:

- **Code Generation**: Implement features from specifications
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated testing, linting, and code review
- **Deployment**: Build, test, and deploy to Screeps servers
- **Monitoring**: Track bot performance and file improvement issues
- **Documentation**: Keep docs synchronized with code changes

### ðŸ”„ Continuous Integration & Deployment

- **Quality Guards**: Automated linting, formatting, testing, and coverage checks on every PR
- **Semantic Versioning**: Automatic version bumping based on conventional commits
- **Automated Releases**: Tagged releases with auto-generated changelogs
- **Screeps Deployment**: Push to Screeps servers on new releases
- **CI Autofix**: Agents automatically fix failing workflows

### ðŸ“Š Self-Evaluation & Improvement

- **Runtime Evaluation**: Bot analyzes its own performance and generates improvement recommendations
- **PTR Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of bot statistics on the Public Test Realm
- **Regression Testing**: Comprehensive test suites prevent quality degradation
- **Coverage Tracking**: Ensure critical code paths remain tested

### ðŸ“š Documentation-First Approach

- **Auto-generated Docs Site**: GitHub Pages site built from markdown documentation
- **Living Documentation**: Docs stay synchronized with code through automation
