/**
 * @fileoverview Regression test for post-merge release workflow - Modernized CI/CD
 *
 * This test ensures that the post-merge release workflow uses modern GitHub DevOps practices:
 * - Direct commits to main (no release PRs)
 * - Semantic versioning based on conventional commits
 * - GitHub Release creation using native API
 * - Concurrency control to prevent race conditions
 *
 * Updated for: https://github.com/ralphschuler/.screeps-gpt/issues/122
 * Previous behavior (release PRs): https://github.com/ralphschuler/.screeps-gpt/actions/runs/18703919715
