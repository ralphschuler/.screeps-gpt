# Screeps Monitoring

The Screeps Monitoring workflow is a comprehensive autonomous analysis system that serves as the "strategic brain" of the Screeps GPT project. It combines bot performance monitoring, PTR telemetry analysis, repository health assessment, and intelligent decision-making to guide project development.

## Overview

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/screeps-monitoring.yml`  
**Schedule:** Every 30 minutes (via cron schedule)  
**Duration:** Up to 45 minutes  
**MCP Servers:** github, screeps-mcp, screeps-api

This workflow provides comprehensive autonomous oversight by analyzing the Screeps bot's in-game performance, monitoring PTR stats for anomalies, evaluating repository health, and making strategic decisions about priorities and improvements. It consolidates the functionality of the former `copilot-autonomous-monitor.yml` and `screeps-stats-monitor.yml` workflows.

## Architecture

### Multi-Phase Analysis Pipeline

The workflow executes in seven mandatory phases:

#### Phase 1: Authentication & Connection Validation

- Authenticates GitHub CLI with repository access
- Verifies Screeps MCP server connection
- Fetches PTR telemetry data using `scripts/fetch-screeps-stats.mjs`
- Fetches bot performance data from game console
- Logs all connection states for debugging

**PTR Telemetry Collection:**

The workflow executes the telemetry fetch script which:

- Uses environment variables: `SCREEPS_TOKEN` (or `SCREEPS_STATS_TOKEN`), `SCREEPS_HOST`, `SCREEPS_STATS_API`
- Fetches user stats from the Screeps API endpoint `/api/user/stats`
- Stores results in `reports/screeps-stats/latest.json`
- Copies snapshot to `reports/copilot/ptr-stats.json` for analysis
- Creates failure snapshot with error details if API is unavailable

#### Phase 2: Bot Performance Analysis

Evaluates game-side performance through three dimensions:

**A. Game State Assessment**

- Spawning status and creep population across rooms
- CPU usage patterns and efficiency metrics
- Energy economy (income, expenses, storage, construction)
- Room control level (RCL) progress and upgrade rates
- Defense capabilities and threat responses

**B. Strategic Execution Evaluation**

- Strategy alignment with documented goals
- Resource allocation and creep behavior bottlenecks
- Room expansion opportunities and territory control
- Trade and market activity analysis

**C. Memory & Performance Health**

- Memory usage and leak detection
- Tick execution time and CPU bucket trends
- Error logs and exception patterns
- Memory segment usage and cleanup

#### Phase 3: PTR Stats Anomaly Detection

Analyzes the PTR telemetry snapshot for critical performance anomalies requiring immediate attention.

**Anomaly Detection Criteria:**

**Critical Priority Anomalies** (`priority/critical`):

- CPU usage > 95% for 3+ consecutive ticks
- Memory crashes or persistent errors
- Zero creep spawning for 10+ ticks when resources available
- Room abandonment without explicit strategy

**High Priority Anomalies** (`priority/high`):

- CPU usage > 80% for 10+ consecutive ticks
- Energy efficiency drop > 20% from baseline
- Creep population deviation > 30% from target
- Construction progress stalled for 50+ ticks

**Medium Priority Anomalies** (`priority/medium`):

- Suboptimal resource allocation patterns
- Minor performance degradations < 10%
- Non-critical strategy execution delays

**Requirements:**

- All anomaly issues must have concrete evidence with exact metric values and thresholds
- All issue titles must start with `PTR:` to identify monitoring findings
- All severity labels must be justified with specific impact assessment
- All analysis must be reproducible with stored snapshot data

After Copilot analysis completes, the workflow also executes `scripts/check-ptr-alerts.ts` which:

- Reads the PTR stats snapshot from `reports/screeps-stats/latest.json`
- Analyzes for high CPU usage (>80% sustained), critical CPU (>95%), and low energy reserves
- Sends push notifications via Push by Techulus for critical and high severity alerts
- Provides real-time alerting independent of issue creation

#### Phase 4: Repository Health Analysis

Evaluates development infrastructure through GitHub MCP tools:

**A. Codebase Quality**

- Recent CI/CD failures and workflow health
- Open issues and PR blockers
- Code coverage trends and test quality
- Technical debt and refactoring needs

**B. Automation Effectiveness**

- Copilot agent activity assessment
- Deployment frequency and success rates
- Monitoring alert patterns
- Documentation freshness

**C. Development Velocity**

- Commit frequency and momentum
- Feature implementation backlog
- Dependency and blocking analysis

#### Phase 5: Strategic Decision Making

Applies intelligent prioritization based on impact assessment:

**Priority Levels:**

- **Critical** (`priority/critical`): Bot non-functional, memory crashes, security vulnerabilities, complete automation failures
- **High** (`priority/high`): Major performance degradation (>20%), strategy execution failures, important CI/CD issues, documentation gaps preventing improvements
- **Medium** (`priority/medium`): Optimization opportunities, refactoring needs, workflow improvements, non-blocking doc updates
- **Low** (`priority/low`): Minor quality improvements, nice-to-have features, documentation polish

#### Phase 6: Autonomous Issue Management

For each identified action:

1. Searches existing issues to prevent duplicates
2. Creates new issues with evidence-based descriptions
   - For strategic issues: Title prefixed with `[Autonomous Monitor]`
   - For PTR anomalies: Title prefixed with `PTR:`
3. Updates existing issues with new analysis
4. Closes resolved issues when fixes are validated

**Issue Quality Requirements:**

- Concrete evidence from bot performance, PTR stats, or repository analysis
- Measurable impact assessment
- Actionable recommendations with alternatives
- Clear success criteria and validation methods

#### Phase 7: Strategic Recommendations

Generates comprehensive analysis report:

- Overall bot health score (0-100 scale)
- PTR performance status (operational/degraded/critical)
- Top 3 priorities for game performance
- Top 3 priorities for development infrastructure
- Emerging opportunities (expansion, optimization, automation)
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

## Safety Controls

### Allowed Actions

✅ Read bot state, memory, and console output  
✅ Execute read-only console commands for analysis  
✅ Fetch and analyze PTR telemetry data  
✅ Create, update, comment on, and close GitHub issues  
✅ Search repository code and documentation  
✅ Analyze workflow logs and automation health

### Prohibited Actions

❌ Execute destructive console commands  
❌ Modify Memory without explicit approval  
❌ Create or merge pull requests automatically  
❌ Change repository settings or secrets  
❌ Deploy code changes automatically

### Rate Limiting

- Maximum 10 GitHub issues created per run
- Maximum 5 Screeps console commands per analysis phase

## Integration with Other Workflows

### Consolidated Monitoring

This workflow consolidates two previously separate monitoring systems:

- **Strategic Autonomous Monitoring**: Comprehensive analysis of bot performance and repository health using MCP servers
- **PTR Stats Monitoring**: High-frequency telemetry collection with anomaly detection and push notifications

The consolidation provides:

- Single workflow execution instead of two parallel runs every 30 minutes
- Combined analysis correlating PTR metrics with strategic performance
- Unified issue creation with consistent labeling and evidence
- Reduced workflow complexity and execution overhead

### Triggers Downstream Automation

Issues created by the monitoring workflow can trigger:

- **Copilot Todo Automation** when labeled with `Todo`
- **Copilot Spec-Kit** for detailed implementation planning when labeled with `speckit`
- **CI Autofix** if monitoring identifies workflow failures

## Best Practices

### Monitoring the Monitor

- Review workflow execution logs weekly for patterns
- Validate that created issues are actionable and accurate
- Adjust priority thresholds if too many/few issues created
- Monitor execution time to ensure 45-minute timeout is sufficient

### Tuning Analysis

- Update prompt template (`.github/copilot/prompts/screeps-monitor`) to refine analysis criteria
- Adjust console commands in Phase 2 for specific metrics
- Customize priority thresholds in Phase 5 based on project needs
- Configure PTR anomaly detection thresholds in Phase 3

### Issue Quality

- Issues should be self-contained with all evidence included
- Validate that recommendations are actionable and specific
- Check for duplicate prevention (search before create)
- Ensure severity labels match actual impact

### Safety Validation

- Audit issue creation patterns to prevent noise
- Verify no destructive actions attempted
- Review rate limiting effectiveness
- Check error handling for API failures

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Fails to Start

- Check `COPILOT_TOKEN` secret is configured
- Verify `SCREEPS_TOKEN` secret exists
- Review workflow syntax with yamllint

### Screeps MCP Connection Fails

- Validate `SCREEPS_TOKEN` has correct permissions
- Check `SCREEPS_HOST` if using private server
- Review MCP config in `.github/mcp/screeps-mcp.json`

### PTR Telemetry Failures

The monitoring system distinguishes between critical infrastructure failures and application-level issues:

- **Network Failures** (Critical): API endpoint completely unreachable
- **Server Errors** (Critical): HTTP 5xx responses from Screeps API
- **Authentication Failures** (High): HTTP 401/403 token issues
- **Empty Response Pattern** (Medium): HTTP 200 with no stats data

See [PTR Infrastructure Failures Guide](../operations/ptr-infrastructure-failures.md) for comprehensive troubleshooting procedures and escalation criteria.

### No Issues Created

- Review strategic decision-making logs for criteria matching
- Check if existing issues prevent duplicates
- Verify bot performance is within normal thresholds

### Timeout Issues

- Review execution logs for slow operations
- Check if MCP servers are responsive
- Consider reducing analysis scope or increasing timeout

### Rate Limiting Hit

- Verify max 10 issues per run not exceeded
- Check max 5 console commands per phase
- Review error handling logs for API failures

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:

- **Trend Analysis**: Track bot health score over time for regression detection
- **Predictive Analysis**: Machine learning to predict issues before they occur
- **Resource Optimization**: Automatic tuning of spawning and upgrade strategies
- **Cross-Shard Analysis**: Compare performance across multiple shards
- **Market Intelligence**: Automated trade and market strategy optimization
- **Expansion Planning**: Territory analysis for optimal room claiming
