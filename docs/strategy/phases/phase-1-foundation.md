# Phase 1: Foundation

**Status**: 85% Complete (In Progress)
**RCL Target**: 1-2
**Timeline**: Started 2024-11-06, Target Completion: 2024-12-01

## Overview

Phase 1 establishes the foundational infrastructure for autonomous bot operation. This includes basic resource gathering, spawning, upgrading, and construction systems that enable the bot to bootstrap from an empty room to a self-sustaining RCL 2 economy.

## Objectives

### Primary Objectives

1. **Autonomous Bootstrapping** - Bot can start from empty room and establish basic economy
2. **Basic Resource Economy** - Harvesters gather energy, upgraders level controller, builders construct extensions
3. **Memory Management** - Persistent state management with automatic cleanup
4. **Spawn Management** - Priority-based creep spawning with role minimums
5. **Construction Planning** - Automatic extension and container placement
6. **Performance Monitoring** - CPU tracking and performance metrics collection

### Success Criteria

| Criterion | Target | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Energy surplus per tick | >10 | ⚠️ Pending telemetry |
| CPU usage per tick | <5 | ⚠️ Pending telemetry |
| Spawn uptime | >90% | ⚠️ Pending telemetry |
| RCL progression | Reach RCL 2 | ✅ Achieved |
| Container harvesting | Operational | 🔄 In Progress |
| Road network | Basic paths | 🔄 Planned |

## Blockers

### Critical Blockers

1. **Telemetry Blackout** (#791)
   - **Impact**: Cannot validate success metrics or identify CPU bottlenecks
   - **Status**: Critical priority
   - **Workaround**: Manual observation in game console
   - **ETA**: Unknown

2. **Container Placement Optimization** (#783)
   - **Impact**: Suboptimal container positions reduce efficiency
   - **Status**: In progress
   - **Workaround**: Manual container placement in-game
   - **ETA**: 1-2 weeks

### Non-Critical Issues

- Memory fragmentation from abandoned creep memory (low impact, cleanup implemented)
- Lack of road network planning (workaround: manual road construction)
- Limited spawn queue visualization (workaround: memory inspection)

## Lessons Learned

### Successful Patterns

1. **Bootstrap Phase Optimization**
   - Dedicated bootstrap phase with harvester-focused spawning dramatically improved early-game stability
   - Energy threshold + extension count provides reliable bootstrap completion detection
   - Related: [Learning: Bootstrap Implementation](../learning/bootstrap-implementation.md)

2. **Container-Based Economy Transition**
   - Automatic detection and role adjustment enables seamless transition from mobile to stationary harvesters
   - Role specialization (stationary harvester + hauler) > generalist harvesters for efficiency
   - Repairer role essential for infrastructure maintenance in container-based economy
   - Related: [Learning: Container-Based Harvesting](../learning/container-based-harvesting.md)

3. **Memory Management**
   - Centralized MemoryManager prevents memory fragmentation
   - Automatic cleanup of dead creep memory prevents memory growth
   - Memory reset hooks enable clean state recovery after code pushes

### Failed Approaches

1. **Generalist Harvesters**
   - Initial approach had harvesters both gathering and transporting energy
   - Problem: High CPU cost from repeated pathfinding, low efficiency
   - Solution: Specialized roles (stationary harvester + hauler) with containers

2. **Static Role Minimums**
   - Fixed role counts didn't adapt to room conditions
   - Problem: Overproduction of harvesters when energy abundant, underproduction of builders when construction needed
   - Solution: Dynamic role adjustment based on room state (partially implemented)

## Dependencies

### Required for Phase 2

Phase 2 (Core Framework) depends on Phase 1 completion:

- **Task System**: Requires stable creep spawning and role management
- **Storage Manager**: Requires container-based economy operational
- **Link Network**: Requires energy surplus and stable economy
- **Path Caching**: Requires baseline CPU budget available

### External Dependencies

- PTR telemetry for metrics validation (#791)
- Container placement algorithm completion (#783)

## Testing

### Test Coverage

- **Unit Tests**: 37+ tests covering bootstrap, memory, pixel generation, logging, repairer
- **Regression Tests**: Extension placement, task system, bootstrap integration
- **E2E Tests**: Phase 1 foundation scenarios

### Test Gaps

- ⚠️ No E2E tests for container-based economy transition
- ⚠️ Limited testing for road network planning (not yet implemented)
- ⚠️ No performance tests for CPU budget validation

## Metrics & Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators

| KPI | Target | Measurement Method |
|-----|--------|-------------------|
| Energy/tick | >10 | PTR telemetry (`Game.rooms[room].energyAvailable` delta) |
| CPU/tick | <5 | PTR telemetry (`Game.cpu.getUsed()`) |
| Spawn utilization | >90% | PTR telemetry (spawning active ticks / total ticks) |
| Creep count | 8-12 | Game state (optimal range for RCL 1-2) |
| Container efficiency | >80% | Energy delivered per CPU spent |

### Monitoring Status

⚠️ **Telemetry Blackout**: PTR stats API broken since 2024-11-13. Metrics cannot be validated until #791 resolved.

**Workarounds**:
- Manual console observation in live game
- Memory inspection for creep counts and role distribution
- Visual inspection of spawn activity and energy surplus

## Next Steps

1. **Resolve Telemetry Blackout** (#791) - Critical for metrics validation
2. **Complete Container Placement** (#783) - Unblocks Phase 1 completion
3. **Implement Road Network Planning** - Reduces CPU cost, improves efficiency
4. **Validate Success Metrics** - Confirm <5 CPU/tick and >10 energy/tick targets met
5. **Phase 1 Retrospective** - Document final lessons learned, update learning docs
6. **Begin Phase 2 Planning** - Task assignment algorithm, storage manager design
