# Strategic Roadmap

This document tracks the current state of bot development, phase completion status, success metrics, and strategic priorities.

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-15

## Current Phase: Phase 1 (Foundation)

**Completion Status**: ~85%

### Phase 1 Success Metrics

| Metric               | Target      | Current Status              |
| -------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Energy Surplus       | >10/tick    | ⚠️ Pending telemetry (#791) |
| CPU Usage            | <5/tick     | ⚠️ Pending telemetry (#791) |
| Spawn Uptime         | >90%        | ⚠️ Pending telemetry (#791) |
| RCL Level            | 2+          | ✅ Achieved                 |
| Container Harvesting | Implemented | 🔄 In Progress (#783)       |

### Phase 1 Blockers

1. **Telemetry Blackout** (#791) - PTR stats monitoring broken, preventing validation of success metrics
2. **Container Placement Optimization** (#783) - Container-based harvesting automation pending completion

### Phase 1 Completed Items

- ✅ Project structure and TypeScript configuration
- ✅ Main game loop with kernel orchestration
- ✅ Memory initialization and reset hooks (MemoryManager)
- ✅ Creep and spawn management (harvester, upgrader, builder roles)
- ✅ Construction planning (BasePlanner for extensions and containers)
- ✅ Pixel generation (PixelGenerator)
- ✅ Structured logging (Logger)
- ✅ Unit tests for memory bootstrapping and core systems
- ✅ Regression tests for extension placement
- ✅ Bootstrap phase implementation for early-game optimization
- ✅ Dynamic role adjustment for container-based economy

### Phase 1 Remaining Items

- [ ] Enhanced spawn priority system with energy threshold checks
- [ ] Complete container-based harvesting automation (#783)
- [ ] Automated road network planning (source → spawn, source → controller)
- [ ] Dynamic role population based on room state
- [ ] CPU usage optimization (<5 CPU/tick target)

## Phase 2: Core Framework (Active)

**Status**: Automatic activation at RCL 4, active development (70% complete)
**Activation**: 2025-11-17 - RCL 4 transition system implemented

### Phase 2 Key Objectives

- Task queue system with priority levels
- Spawn queue with dynamic part generation
- Task assignment algorithm (closest idle creep, capability matching)
- Storage manager for resource distribution
- Link network optimization
- Tower automation for defense and repair
- Centralized memory segments
- Path caching with TTL management
- RoomManager abstraction

### Phase 2 Completed Items

- ✅ Task queue system design and implementation
- ✅ Spawn queue system with priority-based spawning
- ✅ Link network optimization (LinkManager)
- ✅ Tower automation (TowerManager)
- ✅ **RCL 4 phase transition detection and activation**
- ✅ **Link network integration in kernel (RCL 5+)**
- ✅ **Dynamic hauler reduction with operational links**
- ✅ **Storage status monitoring (>10k energy threshold)**

### Phase 2 Remaining Items

- [ ] Task assignment algorithm refinement
- [ ] Storage manager implementation
- [ ] Memory segments for persistent data
- [ ] Path caching with TTL
- [ ] RoomManager abstraction with registry

### Phase 2 Recent Updates (2025-11-17)

**RCL 4 Transition System**:

- Automatic phase detection based on controller level
- Room-level phase tracking in Memory
- Storage placement ready via existing BasePlanner (RCL 4)
- Link network activation at RCL 5 with automatic energy routing
- Hauler count reduced by 50% when link network operational
- Expected CPU savings: 1.5-2.5 CPU/tick
- Expected energy efficiency: +30-40% throughput

**Test Coverage**:

- 13 new regression tests for RCL 3→4 transitions
- Phase detection validation
- Storage status tracking tests
- Multi-room phase management tests

## Strategic Priorities

### Q4 2024 / Q1 2025 Focus

1. **Complete Phase 1** - Unblock telemetry and validate success metrics
2. **Stabilize Phase 2** - Complete task assignment and storage management
3. **Improve Observability** - Restore PTR monitoring and enhance metrics collection
4. **Optimize CPU Usage** - Profile and optimize expensive operations

### Known Technical Debt

- **Memory fragmentation** - Potential optimization in Memory.creeps cleanup
- **Path caching** - Currently no path caching, causing repeated pathfinding operations
- **Task assignment** - Simple distance-based assignment, could use more sophisticated algorithms
- **Error handling** - Some edge cases lack comprehensive error handling

### Expansion Roadmap

**Phase 1 → Phase 2** (Current)

- Prerequisites: Telemetry restored, container harvesting complete, CPU <5/tick
- Estimated Duration: 2-3 weeks
- Key Risks: CPU budget constraints, memory management complexity

**Phase 2 → Phase 3** (Future)

- Prerequisites: Task system stable, storage manager operational, link network deployed
- Estimated Duration: 4-6 weeks
- Key Risks: Remote room coordination complexity, defense requirements

**Phase 3 → Phase 4** (Future)

- Prerequisites: Terminal management working, lab automation complete, factory operational
- Estimated Duration: 6-8 weeks
- Key Risks: Multi-room logistics, resource balancing across rooms

**Phase 4 → Phase 5** (Future)

- Prerequisites: Empire coordination established, combat system functional
- Estimated Duration: 8-12 weeks
- Key Risks: Inter-shard communication, colony expansion algorithms

## Success Validation

Phase completion requires:

1. **All objectives completed** - Core features implemented and tested
2. **Success metrics met** - Quantitative targets achieved and validated via telemetry
3. **No critical blockers** - All high-priority issues resolved
4. **Documentation updated** - Phase documentation, learning insights captured
5. **Regression tests passing** - All tests green, new tests added for new features
